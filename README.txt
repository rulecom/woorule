A [Rule](https://www.rule.io/) integration with WooCommerce.

== Description ==

The WooRule plugin is developed by Rule as an integration between WooCommerce and the Rule marketing automation platform.

The Rule platform is an intuitive and user-friendly digital communication service that streamlines the external communication for companies and organization of any size. Rule enables you to send hyper-personalized and automated digital communications via email and SMS to your customers.

After installing this integration, your WooCommerce data will start sending to Rule. With this data you can enable many e-commerce communication flows such as: newsletters, abandoned cart, order followup, shipping followup, customer retention, customer winback, welcome communications, and much more!

= Usage =

WooRule has automatic event triggers that send data to Rule when a customer places an order. Tags will be applied to the customer within the Rule platform, which can then be used to send automated communications to subscribers (your customers). Data is saved as custom fields, and include information about the subscriber (e.g. name, address, email, phone number), and their order (products ordered, order date, price, discounts, collection, and much more!).

The following events are used to apply the following tags in the customer order flow:

`
#  Event Trigger   Tag Name          Event Description
1  cart updated    CartInProgress    Cart contents are updated
2  processing      OrderProcessing   Order is paid and awaiting fulfillment
3  completed       OrderCompleted    Order fulfilled and complete
4  shipped         OrderShipped      Order was shipped*
`
*This is a custom event trigger that will not trigger unless added by the merchant.
More information regarding order events in WooCommerce can be read [here](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/).

WooRule also includes an optional checkout signup form where customers can easily opt-in to automated marketing communications, such as newsletters.

= Shortcode =

You can embed a Newsletter sign-up form in your posts, or on any page with a simple shortcode `[woorule]`

You can also customize the sign-up form with any of the following shortcode attributes:

`
[woorule title="Custom Title" placeholder="Custom Placeholder Text" button="Custom Button Text" checkbox="Custom Text Next To Checkbox" success="Custom Success Message" tag="Custom Tag" require_opt_in=false]
`

The `checkbox` attribute will add a checkbox below the signup form. If this attribute is present then checking the checkbox is required before the form can be submitted. This is useful for ensuring the subscriber agrees to your terms before being added to a mailing list.

The `tag` attribute will be applied to the subscriber when the form is submitted. If no tag field is used a `Newsletter` tag will be applied by default.

The `require_opt_in` attribute, if set to `true`, will require the subscriber to accept an opt-in email before further marketing emails can be sent. The opt-in flow requires you to have a [subscriber form](https://app.rule.io/#/subscriber/subscriber-form) setup in your Rule account in order for the opt-in email to be sent to the subscriber. Note that the `tag` attribute should be the same as the form tag.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it cost anything to use this plugin? =

All of Rule’s integrations are offered for free!

= Do I need an account in Rule? =

In order to take advantage of this integration you will need an account in Rule. You can [sign up for a free account](https://www.rule.io/sign-up-free/) and start using Rule in just a few minutes!

= Is it difficult to integrate? =

No, just follow the simple setup steps and you’re up and running in minutes! We have [extensive documentation](https://en.docs.rule.se/) and support staff to help get you started with automating your digital marketing and communications.

= How do I migrate from version 1.x? =

In versions 2.0+, all manual mailing rules are removed and are replaced with automatic event triggers. The same data is sent to Rule, however the event tag names may differ from the tags you originally set up. Refer to the [Usage](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woorule/#details) section for more information on the exact events and tags that are used.

To make sure your automations in Rule are not interrupted with the updated tag names, make sure to either update the tags associated with your automation, or [create a tag filter](https://en.docs.rule.se/article/172-filter-sa-fungerar-det) to trigger an automation based on both the old tag names and the new tag names.
